# Farmer Inc.
A casual-simulation farming game.

An independent project I made over the summer just for fun. Explored object oriented design principles that I learned in college.

## Concept
1. The player begins with a 9 plot farm and 350 dollars.
2. The player uses his farm to plant, grow, and harvest crops to grow a profit. 

## Main Components
1. Farm
2. Market
3. Inventory
